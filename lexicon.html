'bout tenyears ago they was usin'bleach to freebase but now bakin' soda is word.

What d'ya call themthings that theygrind things in. That.. And you grind it all up in a pot, then while that isbeing grinded, someone'staking a pork shoulder and dicing it, cubes.  After dice it you put it in thepot with just blackpepper and adobo. You don't put any oil or nothing in it you just let thatheat up as it is until it'sbrown or seems cooked.  It's a bunch of people making these things because ittakes a lot ofenergy and a lot of time-- while maybe the kids are grinding the yucca andother family membersare dicing the meat-- you can make the sofrito.SofritoDice everythingOne pack of coriander leaves1 pimientoI oniontwo giant spoonful of oil in pan1 pote de of salsa de tomate4 tablespoons of achiote1/2 bottle of olivestwo packs of sassonand sprinkle a lot of adobolow fire when donesofrito's those things you find in cans but we make it from scratch.
